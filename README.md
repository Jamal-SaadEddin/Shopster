## Overview
Shopster is a shopping cart interface developed as a part of my front-end internship at Foothill Technology Solutions. The application allows users to browse a variety of products, add them to a shopping cart, view cart details, remove items, and proceed to checkout. This project showcases my ability to manage state using React Contexts, Reducers, and Providers.

## Features
- **Product Grid:** Displays products in a grid format with name, image, and price.
- **Add to Cart:** Allows users to add products to the shopping cart.
- **Cart Details:** Lists all items added to the cart.
- **Item Removal:** Provides an option to delete individual items from the cart.
- **Total Amount:** Displays the cumulative price of the items in the cart.
- **Checkout:** Includes a form for users to input their name and email for order submission.
- **Search Feature:** Enables users to search for products by name.
